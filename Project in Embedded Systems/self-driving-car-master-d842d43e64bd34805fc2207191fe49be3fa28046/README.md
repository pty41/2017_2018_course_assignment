# Embedded Systems Project 2017

## Environment setup instructions

### Backend development

We are using python virtual environment for developing and running the system.
Virtual environment requires following packages to be installed into your computer:

- Python3 --> v. 3.5.2
- pip --> v. 9.0.1
- virtualenv --> v. 15.0.1

When the above packages are installed to your computer, you can create a virtual
environment by running following command:

`virtualenv -p python3 virtualenv.self_driving_car`

After setup is completed, you can activate virtualenv by running following command:

`./virtualenv.self_driving_car/bin/activate`

Once the virtualenv is active, navigate in command line to the repository

`cd self-driving-car/`

Then install requirements for the backend software by running following command:

`pip install -r requirements_backend.txt`

After setup is complete you can start developing the code and run python software by
simply typing in command line:

`python filename.py`
